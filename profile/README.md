The Graphopedia is the biggest online catalogue of types of data visualizations and infographics.
The list includes general-purpose visualization types. Each type is given a definition, its anatomy, examples, tools for creating the visualization, and the sources.

The current catalog contains about 200 entries of charts and their variations and is constantly expanding.


## The data

When it comes to choosing the right type of chart for an infographic, the possibilities are unlimited. The list we compiled focuses on visualization types that have been described in scientific literature such that we know their advantages and disadvantages, and most importantly how readers interact with them.

Some chart types are popular in presentations and business but not researched by scientists. Such examples include the bullet chart, the waterfall chart, the pyramid diagram, and the funnel chart, among others. We still included them because they are widely used and often for their role as a metaphor rather than a statistical graphic.

While many of the listed charts are types of data visualization, meaning statistical graphs, many are pure information graphics techniques that include visual metaphor, illustrations, and diagrams. We use the term "information graphics" to include both data visualizations and infographics.


## Why We Created Infographopedia

We are information designers who build infographic-making software Adioma. We have to know what chart and diagram types are out there and how people use them. We also need to see the best examples of them to keep up our quality of infographics and icons.
